Both of the temporary modular housing sites in Richmond have a safe-injection site, but they are only for residents of those buildings.

    In a press release, RCC said certain candidates “seem to advocate for Richmond taxpayers’ money to fund injection site facilities,” and questioned whether they had a “hidden agenda” to “impose” safe-injection sites in Richmond “without consultation or accountability to Richmond residents and businesses.”`,

    cardDetailedText: `I am a resident of Richmond, BC, and a parent to a six-year-old child. I am deeply concerned about the proposed construction of a safe drug consumption site in our community. This is not just an abstract issue for me; it's personal.
The introduction of such a facility will inevitably attract more drug addicts to our city. This could lead to an increase in crime rates and public safety issues that would directly affect us all - especially our children who are growing up here. Furthermore, there are potential health risks associated with these sites that cannot be ignored.
Our concerns are will the communities with safe consumption sites would increase in drug-related crimes and public disorder incidents. Additionally, while these sites aim at reducing harm among users, they can inadvertently contribute to increased substance abuse due to easy access.
We understand that those struggling with addiction need help and support but introducing such facilities might not be the best solution for everyone involved – especially when considering its potential negative impacts on communities like ours.
We urge you to reconsider this decision for the sake of all Richmond residents' safety and well-being. Please sign this petition if you share these concerns.
